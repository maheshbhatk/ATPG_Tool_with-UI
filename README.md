# ATPG_Tool_with-UI
Created a end to end Open source Tool. Runs ATPG Algorithm(PODEM), Testablilty measures(SCOAP Analysis) for the Circuit created by user in Graphical User Interface


Designed a user interface where the user can create own gate level circuit.
Performed Testability measures using SCOAP analysis written in Python.
Implemented PODEM algorithm in Python to find input patterns to detect the different stuck at faults given in the fault list by the user.
